# vsndjango

### Requirements

python 2.7.10
```
Django==1.8.3
MySQL-python==1.2.5
wheel==0.24.0
```

## Installation

### 1. virtualenv
Create a virtualenv for your own project with virtualenvwrapper, where `vsndjango` is the name of your project:

`$ mkvirtualenv --clear vsndjango`

### 2. Download
Now, you need the vsndjango project files in your workspace:

    $ cd /path/to/your/workspace
    $ git clone git://github.com/stefanlyew/vsndjango.git && cd vsndjango

### 3. Requirements

`$ pip install -r requirements.txt`

#### 4. Create the database
Make sure you have created a database in MySQL's interactive prompt:

`$ mysql.server start`
`$ mysql -u root -p`
`Enter password:`

`mysql> CREATE DATABASE vsndjango_development`
`Query OK, 1 row affected (0.01 sec)``
`mysql> quit`

Make sure that these steps match for your configuration in /vsndjango/settings.py!

#### 5. Setup the database
`./manage.py syncdb`

The Import Command Parses the CSV file vsn_data.csv and seeds the database with
Vehicle Records from it
`./manage.py import`

### 6. Ready? Go!
`./manage.py runserver`

### Known Issues
If you are receiving and error on "./manage.py import":
this is probably because of carriage return differences between unix and mac
make sure to convert CRLF to LF for the file vsn_data.csv

### Areas for improvement, ideas for version 2, etc.
I would like to learn how to write tests for Python

The VSN number applied to each vehicle by each manufacturer will be in a variety
of different formats.  We will need to extend the VSNDataParser into classes
that can handle each manufacturer separately.  Different VSN's mean different
things to each manufacturer.
